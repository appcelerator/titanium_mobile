name: Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService
summary: A background service that runs when the application is placed in the background.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
platforms: [iphone,ipad]
since: "1.5"
createable: false
properties:
  - name: url
    summary: A local URL to a JavaScript file containing the code to run in the background.
    type: String
    availability: creation
    default: none
methods:
  - name: stop
    summary: Stops the service from running during the current background session to conserve resources.
    description: |
        Currently, calling `stop` both halts the current execution of the background 
        service, **and** unregisters it, so that it will not run again unless it is re-registered.
        This is a known issue.
  - name: unregister
    summary: Unregisters the background service.

    The BackgroundService is created by <Titanium.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService>. When
    creating a background service, you specify a local URL to a JavaScript file. The code
    in the JavaScript file is executed each time the background service runs.

    The background service runs when the application is placed in the background and will 
    continue to run until one of the following occurs:
    
    * The application resumes.

    * The service is stopped with the `stop` method.
    
    * The OS terminates the service for one of the reasons discussed in 
      "Background Service Limitations", below.

    #### Known Issues 

    Note that there are several issues with the current implementation of 
    background services:

    * The background service runs when the Application is placed in the background and will 
      continue to run until the service is stopped with the `stop` method, however, this also
      unregisters the service.

    * Calling `unregister` on the background service *unregisters* the service, but does not
      stop the background task under which the service was launched. This can lead to having
      multiple tasks running in the background.

    * Calling `register` multiple times with the same URL results in multiple instances of
      the same service being run.
    
    These issues will be addressed in a future release. To work around these issues, the
    application must:

    * Unregister the background service when the application resumes.

    * Re-register the background service when the application pauses.
    
    #### Background Service Limitations

    Note that even with these workarounds, the background service is subject to limitations
    imposed by the operating system. In particular:

    * The OS limits the total amount of time the background service can run for after the 
      application is suspended, typically to no more than 10 minutes.

    * The OS may terminate the background service at any point to reclaim resources.
