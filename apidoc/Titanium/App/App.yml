name: Titanium.App
summary: The top level App module. The App module is mainly used for accessing information about the application at runtime.
description: |
    The `App` module exposes a number of properties set in the `tiapp.xml` file. 
    Three of these properties, the application name, ID, and URL, must be specified in the 
    new project wizard when you create an application. 
    
    Most values can be changed by editing the `tiapp.xml` file after creating the project.
    However, the GUID property is automatically generated and should not be changed.

extends: Titanium.Module
since: "0.1"
methods:
  - name: getArguments
    summary: Return the arguments passed to the application on startup as a dictionary.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    returns:
        type: Dictionary
events:
  - name: proximity
    summary: Fired when the iPhone proximity sensor changes state.
    description: |
        The iOS proximity sensor detects whether the device is being held up 
        to the user's ear, and shuts down the display.

        If [proximityDetection](Titanium.App.proximityDetection) is `true`,
        events are generated whenever the proximity sensor changes state.
    properties:
      - name: state
        summary: Proximity state value.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: resume
    summary: Fired when an iOS application will enter the foreground due to iOS 4's multitasking.
    description: |
        This does not include pauses due to notifications or calls. See
        [applicationWillEnterForeground](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006728-CH3-SW108) for
        the exact behavior that triggers this event.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: resumed
    summary: Fired when an iOS application will return to being the focus. 
    description: |
        This includes not
        only the events that trigger the `resume` event, but also pauses due to notifications 
        or calls. See
        [applicationDidBecomeActive](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006786-CH3-SW10) for
        the exact behavior that triggers this event.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: pause
    summary: Fired when an iOS application will stop being the focus. 
    description: |
        This includes not only the user leaving the application, 
        but also pauses due to notifications or calls. See [applicationWillResignActive](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006786-CH3-SW10) 
        for the exact behavior that triggers this event.
        
        Note that making calls to functions which modify the UI during this
        event may cause execution **up to** the UI call before the suspension,
        but then execute the **remainder** of the callback after the application is
        resumed (but before the `resume` event is triggered).
