    summary: A banner view action can cover your application's user interface. However, your application continues to run, and receives events normally. If your application receives an event that requires the user's attention, it can programmatically cancel the action and uncover its interface by calling cancelAction. Canceling actions frequently can cause a loss of revenue for your application.

properties:
  - name: adSize
    summary: The size of the advertisement when minimized.
    description: |
        Apple only allows setting ads as specific sizes, meaning that
        traditional view sizing does not affect ads. Ads always
        display in full-screen mode when a user clicks on them. 
        Should be set to either [AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT)
        or [AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE](Titanium.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE). Attempting
        to set this property to any other value will cause an exception.
        
        Users are still allowed to set the view's [width](Titanium.UI.View.width)
        and [height](Titanium.UI.View.height), but this does not affect the size
        of the ad itself. It is recommended that the `auto` value is used for
        these properties instead, to compute the view's size from the adSize.
