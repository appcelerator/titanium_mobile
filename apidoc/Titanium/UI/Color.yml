name: Titanium.UI.Color
summary: |
    Represents a color used for UI components.
description: |
    This type may be used on iOS for assignment to any property typically taking a String color value.
    A developer is not expected to typically interact with a <Titanium.UI.Color> object, as we generate them
    under the hood when converting the passed in String representations. One major exception is use of the 
    <Titanium.UI.fetchSemanticColor> method, which will return an instance to be passed to UI components.
    This instance will automatically "adapt" the receiver to light/dark mode changes.

    Note that Android does not currently support passing in instances of this type for UI components/properties!

    See [UI Element Colors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/ui_element_colors?language=objc) and
    [Standard Colors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/standard_colors?language=objc) for lists of
    named colors to pass to <Titanium.UI.fetchSemanticColor> on iOS.

    summary: Returns a hex string representation of the color
    description: |
        The returned value is an uppercase hex representation of the color with a leading '#'. If fully opaque,
        the alpha hex values will be omitted. For example, black would return '#000000'. Black with a 50% opacity
        would return '#00000080'
