        family is used. 

        On Android, the generic names "sans-serif," "serif," and "monospace" (or "monospaced") are 
        mapped to system fonts. On iOS, only "monospace" is supported.

    description: |
        On iOS, font sizes are always specified in typographical points 
        (not to be confused with the Apple "points" used for other measurements). 

        On Android the default font sizing is in pixels, but the size can also 
        include a unit specifier. Supported units and their specifiers are:
        
        * pixels (px)
        * typographical points (pt)
        * density-independent pixels (dp or dip)
        * millimeters (mm)
        * inches (in) 
        
        For example, "16dp" specifies a size of 16 density-independent pixels. 

        iOS ingores any unit specifier after the size value.
