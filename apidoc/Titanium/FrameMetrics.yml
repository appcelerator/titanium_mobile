name: Titanium.FrameMetrics
summary: Proxy containing performance information about rendered frames.
description: |
    On Android N and above FrameMetrics provides access to performance information
    in a rendered frame lifecycle. 

    Various milestones can be accessed through the proxy's constants.

    More information at:
    [FrameMetrics API for Android N](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0.html#framemetrics_api)
since: "7.0.0"
platforms: [android]

properties:
  - name: ANIMATION_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for animation callback duration.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed issuing animation callbacks.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: COMMAND_ISSUE_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for command issue duration.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed issuing draw commands to the GPU.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: DRAW_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for draw duration.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed computing DisplayLists for
        transformations applied to the view hierarchy.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: FIRST_DRAW_FRAME
    summary: Boolean value determining whether this frame was the first to draw in a new Window layout.
    description: |
        [getMetric](Titanium.FrameMetrics.getMetric) will return 0 for false, 1 for true.

        First draw frames are expected to be slow and should usually be exempt from display jank
        calculations as they do not cause skips in animations and are usually hidden by window
        animations or other tricks.

    permission: read-only

  - name: INPUT_HANDLING_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for input handling duration.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed issuing input handling callbacks.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: INTENDED_VSYNC_TIMESTAMP
    summary: Identifier for the timestamp of the intended vsync for this frame.
    description: |
        The intended start point for the frame. If this value is different from VSYNC_TIMESTAMP,
        there was work occurring on the UI thread that prevented it from responding to the vsync
        signal on time.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: LAYOUT_MEASURE_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for layout/measure duration.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed measuring and laying out the invalidated
        pieces of the view hierarchy.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: SWAP_BUFFERS_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for swap buffers duration.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed issuing the frame buffer for this frame to
        the display subsystem.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: SYNC_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for sync duration.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed synchronizing the computed display lists
        with the render thread.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: TOTAL_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for total frame duration.
    description: |
        Represents the total time in nanoseconds this frame took to render and be issued to the
        display subsystem. Equal to the sum of the values of all other time-valued metric identifiers.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: UNKNOWN_DELAY_DURATION
    summary: Identifier for unknown delay.
    description: |
        Represents the number of nanoseconds elapsed waiting for the UI thread to become responsive and
        process the frame. This should be 0 most of the time.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only

  - name: VSYNC_TIMESTAMP
    summary: Identifier for the timestamp of the actual vsync for this frame.
    description: |
        The time value that was used in all the vsync listeners and drawing for the frame.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only
