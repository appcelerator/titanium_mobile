# Welcome to your Titanium Angular project

> ⚠️ Titanium Angular is currently only available as a preview and under ongoing development. Expect things to be broken or APIs to change as this project matures. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

This project was created using the default Angular project template. It is a dead simple app that demonstrates basic concepts of Titanium Angular, including:

- Using Titanium views in templates
- Property and event binding
- Routing

For more examples check out the [sample app](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-angular/tree/master/ti-angular-example) in the [titanium-angular](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-angular) repository.
